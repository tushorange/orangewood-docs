Python Client makes the following interfaces available:

    - **`gRPC Interface`**
    - **`Socket Interface`**


Both interfaces are available to be used through a single Python class **`OwlClient`**

:::info note

These interfaces allow users to develop custom Python applications around OWLRobot. When developing custom applications using the Python client, commands are no longer sent directly to the robotâ€™s internal controls.
