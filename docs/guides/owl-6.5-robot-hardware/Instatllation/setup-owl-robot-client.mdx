# Installation
The OWLRobot is running `gRPC` and Socket server on all the available IP addresses. To operate the OWLRobot over a Local Area Network (LAN), we must first configure the network so that the client computer can access the OWLRobot host.

## Setting up a OWL robot for OWL_Client

### Network Setup
The robot has a static IP address assigned, which is **10.42.0.54** ,but you can check it by opening the network settings from the NUC
<span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'violet' }}>(Settings -> Network -> Wired)</span>. A direct connection from the PC to the Robot reduces network hardware delay.


    - Connect the OWL control box directly to the remote PC with an ethernet cable.
    - On the remote PC, turn off all network devices except the **“wired connection”**, e.g. turn off wifi.
    - Open Network Settings and create a new Wired connection with these settings. You may want to name this new connection OWL or something similar:

``` 
IPv4
Manual
Address: 10.42.0.52
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 10.42.0.1
```
    - Verify the connection from the remote PC with e.g. ping.
```
ping 10.42.0.54
```


### OWL Client PC 

For using the owl python client make sure it is installed. You can only install it from the bitbucket source currently.

    - Clone the owl_robot_client repository in local PC.
    ```bash
    git clone https://Orangewoodlabs@bitbucket.org/owl-dev/owl_robot_client.git -b main
    ```

    - Install the Python library by running the following commands in the cloned directory:

```bash
$ cd owl_robot_client
$ pip install -e .
```
    - To verify library is installed successfully or not, execute the following commands in a terminal.
    ```python
    # Make sure python3 is installed
    $ python3
    Python 3.8.10 (default)
    >>> from owl_client import OwlClient
    >>>
    ```
