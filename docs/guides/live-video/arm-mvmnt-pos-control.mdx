  Learn how to control the robotic arm's position and orientation with the Positions API.

The Positions API allows you to control the robot's position and orientation in space.

### Tooltip Positions vs. Joint Positions
The robotic arm can be moved based on either tooltip positions or joint positions. A Joint Position represents the arm as a set of six joint rotations measured in radians. In contrast, a Tooltip Position defines the arm's location and orientation within a three-dimensional space.

### Reference Frames
The robot's position is established relative to reference frames. There are two pre-defined frames: the base and world frames. You can also create custom reference frames using the Orangewood Bots application to suit your specific needs.

### The move() Function
The `move()` function simplifies the process of moving the robot's tooltip to a specific position and orientation in space. It acts as a shortcut for calling `set_arm_position()` with an `ArmPositionUpdateRequest` where the kind is set to `TooltipPosition`.
