# Introduction

Dyte's React UI Kit is a prebuilt design library of UI components that makes it
easy to integrate video and voice calls into any app or website within minutes.

## Usage

The UI Kit is a design library of prebuilt UI components built on top of the
core SDKs. Core SDK handles all the low-level media and network handling parts
of a meeting and exposes APIs that the UI Kit uses.

The library uses a layered design structure allowing you to start with a prebuilt component and slowly go down layers and add custom UI incrementally as your needs evolve.

- **Use prebuilt component**: You can use prebuilt `<DyteMeeting />` component to
  create your meeting quickly. With this component, you don't have to handle all
  the states, dialogs, and other aspects of managing the application. The UI kit
  also respect your permissions and theming configuration from the preset.

- **Mix and match**: Use some components from our component library, build some custom components yourself. Read the [basics of our component design](/react-ui-kit/basics/integrate) and checkout the [gallery of available components](/react-ui-kit/components)
