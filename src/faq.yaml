- question: What is the Orangewood Simulation Stack?
  tags: ["General"]
  answer: |-
    The Orangewood Simulation Stack is a repository that contains simulation packages and MoveIt! configurations for the Orangewood indigenous OWL 6.5 Robot, along with SDK examples.

- question: What are the prerequisites for setting up the simulation on a host PC?
  tags: ["General"]
  answer: |-
    To set up the simulation on a host PC, you need:
    - Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
    - ROS Noetic (either full desktop installation or single line installation).

- question: How do I install ROS Noetic on my host PC?
  tags: ["General"]
  answer: |-
    You can install ROS Noetic using a single line command. Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orangewood-co/orangewood_sim_stack/main/host_pc_scripts/ros_install_noetic.sh && chmod +x ./ros_install_noetic.sh && ./ros_install_noetic.sh
    ```

- question: How can I set up the ROS workspace for the Orangewood simulation?
  tags: ["General"]
  answer: |-
    To set up the ROS workspace, execute the following commands in the terminal:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/orangewood_ws/src
    cd ~/orangewood_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/orangewood-co/orangewood_sim_stack.git
    cd ~/orangewood_ws
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    catkin_make -j1
    echo "source ~/orangewood_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> /home/$USER/.bashrc
    source /home/$USER/.bashrc
    ```

- question: What command should I use to run the Gazebo simulation for the OWL 6.5 Robot?
  tags: ["General"]
  answer: |-
    To start the Gazebo simulation, use the following command:
    ```bash
    roslaunch owl_bringup bringup.launch gripper:=robotiq2f85 world:=table camera:=on sim:=on time:=5
    ```

- question: What is the OWL Robot SDK?
  tags: ["General"]
  answer: |-
    The OWL Robot SDK is a Python module designed to operate the OWLRobot in Gazebo using MoveIt. It provides a simple API to control the robot's movements and interactions.

- question: How do I install the OWL Robot SDK?
  tags: ["General"]
  answer: |-
    You can install the OWL Robot SDK by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install owl-robot-sdk
    ```

- question: What is the purpose of the example code provided?
  tags: ["General"]
  answer: |-
    The example code demonstrates how to use the OWL Robot SDK APIs to control the robot's movements, check its status, and manage gripper operations. It showcases various functionalities such as getting the robot's status, moving to specific poses, and adding/removing obstacles.

- question: What should I do if I encounter issues while using the SDK?
  tags: ["General"]
  answer: |-
    Ensure that you have the correct environment set up, including the OWL Robot Simulation running on Gazebo. Check for any error messages in the terminal and refer to the documentation for troubleshooting tips.

# Technical FAQs
#

- question: Can I customize the robot's movements?
  tags: ["Technical"]
  answer: |-
    Yes, you can customize the robot's movements by modifying the trajectory and pose parameters in the example code. The SDK allows you to specify the target positions for the robot's TCP and joints.

- question: How can I add obstacles in the simulation?
  tags: ["Technical"]
  answer: |-
    You can add obstacles using the `add_obstacle` method of the `OwlSimClient`. You need to specify the obstacle's name, dimensions, position, and type (e.g., box, cone, mesh).

- question: Is it possible to control the gripper using the SDK?
  tags: ["Technical"]
  answer: |-
    Yes, the SDK provides methods to control the gripper, allowing you to open or close it by specifying the desired state or value.

- question: Where can I find more examples or detailed documentation for the OWL Robot SDK?
  tags: ["Technical"]
  answer: |-
    Additional examples and detailed documentation can be found in the repository of the OWL Robot SDK, where you can explore more functionalities and usage patterns.

- question: How do I run the simulation and MoveIt bringup?
  tags: ["Technical"]
  answer: |-
    Before using the OWL Robot SDK, ensure you have run the simulation and MoveIt bringup from the OWL Robot Simulation repository. Follow the setup instructions provided in that repository.

- question: What features does the OWL Robot SDK provide?
  tags: ["Technical"]
  answer: |-
    The OWL Robot SDK includes features such as:
    - Getting the robot's running status and version.
    - Retrieving the robot's TCP (Tool Center Point) position and joint values.
    - Moving the robot to specific poses or joint configurations.
    - Controlling the gripper (open/close) and handling obstacles in the simulation.

- question: What options are available for the gripper in the simulation?
  tags: ["Technical"]
  answer: |-
    The available options for the gripper are:
    - pneumatic
    - vacuum
    - robotiq2f85

- question: What world options can I choose from in the simulation?
  tags: ["Technical"]
  answer: |-
    The available world options are:
    - empty
    - stand
    - table

- question: Can I disable the Gazebo simulation and run only the MoveIt configuration?
  tags: ["Technical"]
  answer: |-
    Yes, you can disable the Gazebo simulation by setting the `sim` option to "off" and the `time` option to 0. However, it's recommended to set a time value from 5 to 10 seconds for starting the simulation.

- question: What should I do if I encounter issues during setup or usage?
  tags: ["Technical"]
  answer: |-
    Ensure that all prerequisites are met, including the correct version of Ubuntu and ROS. Review error messages in the terminal and consult the documentation for troubleshooting guidance.
