## Overview

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
  A python interface for controlling and receiving data from the OWL robot.
</div>

### Modes

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>NOT_AVAILABLE</strong>: This mode indicates that the robot is unavailable for operation. It is typically encountered when the robotâ€™s boot-up sequence fails to complete successfully. In this state, the robot is unable to perform its intended functions or respond to commands.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>POWER_OFF</strong>: This mode indicates that the robot is not powered. In this state, the robot will only respond to power on command.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>IDLE</strong>: This mode indicates that the robot is available to all types of valid operations. In this state, the robot is able to perform its intended functions or respond to commands.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>RUNNING</strong>: This mode indicates that the robot is executing a program script or a move command. In this state, the robot will not respond to TeachMode command.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>PAUSED</strong>: This mode indicates that the robot has paused executing a program script or a move command. In this state also, the robot will not respond to TeachMode command.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>TEACH_MODE</strong>: This mode indicates that the robot is in manual move mode (FreeDrive or JogDrive). In this state, the robot will not respond to any execution commands such as program script or move.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ERROR</strong>: This mode indicates that the robot previously shut down abnormally due to a sudden power failure and was unable to save the last encoder position. In this state, the robot must re-zero the position to resume normal operation.
    </li>
  </ul>

# Fetching the Current Robot Mode

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
  The current robot mode can be easily obtained via the Python client. Below is a code snippet showing how to do it:
</div>

```python
from owl_client import OwlClient

client = OwlClient("10.42.0.54")

# Return an integer value representing current robot mode
print("Robot Current Mode :", client.get_robot_mode())
```
## Robot Modes Table

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
  Below is a table summarizing the robot modes along with their corresponding values:
</div>

| **Robot Mode**      | **Value** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| NOT_AVAILABLE       | -1        |
| POWER_OFF           | 0         |
| IDLE                | 1         |
| RUNNING             | 3         |
| PAUSED              | 2         |
| TEACH_MODE          | 5         |
| ERROR               | -2        |
